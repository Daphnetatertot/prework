# Daphne's Full Stack Study Guide

## This website offers a quick rundown of what you'd learn in a coding bootcamp. It is divided up by language with notes about each one. I created this project to encourage people like me to learn to code. The purpose of this study guide is to show people that anyone can learn coding if they just put a little time into it! Through building this web application I learned that the hardest part of coding really is simply learning the syntax. Once you've gotten that under your belt, the possibilities are endless. 

## Installation
